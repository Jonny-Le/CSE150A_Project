## Dataset (5pts)

### Dataset Description

**What are the primary features of the dataset?:**
- **Beer Characteristics**: 
  - `abv` (Alcohol by Volume): Continuous, 0.03-0.12 range
  - `ibu` (International Bitterness Units): Continuous, 0-200 range  
  - `ounces` (Serving size): Continuous, typically 12-16 oz
- **Categorical Information**: 
  - `style`: 100+ unique beer styles (IPA, Stout, Lager, etc.)
  - `brewery_id`: Unique brewery identifiers
- **Quality Metrics**: 
  - `rating`: User ratings on 0-5 scale
  - `bin_rating`: Binary classification target (liked ≥3.5, not liked <3.5)
- **Engineered Features**: 
  - `abv_filled`: Filled missing abv values with median for model training
  - `ibu_filled`: Filled missing ibu values with median for model training
  - `brewery_reputation`: Average rating per brewery
  - `style_popularity`: Frequency count of each style
  - `abv_category_encoded`: Categorical ABV ranges (Low/Medium/High/Very High)
  - `ibu_category_encoded`: Categorical bitterness levels

**Data Source & Reliability:**
- Beer review dataset from craft beer rating platforms
- Contains real-world beer characteristics and user preferences
- Missing values: ~57 ABV records, ~1000 IBU records requiring median imputation
- Data appears reliable with reasonable value ranges and distributions

**Data Types:**
- **Continuous**: ABV, IBU, ounces, brewery_reputation, style_popularity (5 features)
- **Categorical**: Style, brewery_id, encoded categorical features (3 features)
- **Mixed data types** requiring careful preprocessing for Naive Bayes

**What task(s) can you accomplish with this data?:**
1. **Binary Classification**: Predict beer preference (liked/not liked)
2. **Personalized Recommendation**: Filter and rank beers by user preferences
3. **Pattern Discovery**: Identify relationships between beer characteristics and ratings

**Is the data relevant to probabilistic modeling?:**
- **Inherent Uncertainty**: User taste preferences are subjective and probabilistic
- **Bayesian Inference**: Learn patterns from historical ratings to predict future preferences  
- **Feature Independence**: Reasonable first approximation that beer characteristics contribute independently
- **Confidence Scores**: Probabilistic outputs provide recommendation confidence

**How will you preprocess your data?:**
```python
# Handle missing values
df_processed['abv_filled'] = df_processed['abv'].fillna(df_processed['abv'].median())
df_processed['ibu_filled'] = df_processed['ibu'].fillna(df_processed['ibu'].median())

# Create categorical features
df_processed['abv_category'] = pd.cut(df_processed['abv_filled'], 
                                     bins=[0, 0.045, 0.065, 0.085, 1.0])
# Engineer reputation features
brewery_avg = df_processed.groupby('brewery_id')['rating'].mean()
df_processed['brewery_reputation'] = df_processed['brewery_id'].map(brewery_avg)

# Binary classification target
df_processed['bin_rating'] = (df_processed['rating'] >= 3.5).astype(int)
```

## PEAS/Agent Analysis (10pts)

### PEAS Framework

**Performance Measure:**
- **Primary**: Classification accuracy on beer preference prediction (~75%)
- **Secondary**: User satisfaction with personalized recommendations
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC for binary classification

**Environment:**
- **Static beer database** with fixed characteristics (ABV, IBU, style, brewery)
- **Dynamic user preferences** collected through interactive questionnaire
- **Partially observable**: Limited user information through 4-question preference survey

**Actuators:**
- **Recommendation Output**: Ranked list of 10 beers with probability scores
- **Filtering System**: Remove beers not matching user strength/bitterness/style preferences
- **Explanation Interface**: Display beer characteristics and match reasoning

**Sensors:**
- **User Input**: Preference questionnaire (strength, bitterness tolerance, style preferences, avoided styles)
- **Beer Features**: Continuous (ABV, IBU, reputation) and categorical (style, categories) data
- **Historical Patterns**: Rating distributions and feature relationships from training data

### Problem Definition & Approach


**Core Problem**: Predict individual beer preferences in a domain with high subjective variability and sparse user data.

**Why Probabilistic Modeling Makes Sense:**
1. **Uncertainty Management**: Taste preferences are inherently uncertain and context-dependent
2. **Sparse User Data**: Limited preference information requires generalization from patterns
3. **Confidence Quantification**: Probabilistic outputs indicate recommendation reliability
4. **Feature Integration**: Bayesian approach naturally combines multiple evidence sources

### Related Work & Model Comparison

**Collaborative Filtering:**
- **Approach**: User-user or item-item similarity matrices
- **Benefits**: Leverages community preferences, handles complex taste interactions
- **Drawbacks**: Requires extensive user-item interaction data (cold start problem)
- **Not applicable**: Our dataset lacks user interaction history

**Content-Based Filtering (Our Approach):**
- **Approach**: Predict preferences based on item features
- **Benefits**: Works with limited user data, explainable recommendations
- **Implementation**: Naive Bayes classification on beer characteristics
- **Limitation**: May miss complex feature interactions

**Our Model Choice: Gaussian Naive Bayes**
- **Rationale**: Handles mixed continuous/categorical features, fast training, probabilistic output
- **Trade-offs**: Assumes feature independence, may miss interaction effects

#### Conclusion 

![HEAT MAP FOR BEER RATING](image.png)
Looking at the HMM model I provided, let me explain what it actually accomplishes and its limitations:

##### What the Model Does:

###### 1. **Beer Quality Classification**
- Categorizes beers into 3 hidden states: Low_Quality, Medium_Quality, High_Quality
- Based on features like ABV, IBU, and beer style
- Uses a simple scoring system (not very sophisticated)

###### 2. **Rating Prediction Framework**
- Maps continuous ratings (0-5) to discrete bins: Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent
- Learns probability distributions of ratings given quality states
- Creates emission probabilities P(rating | quality)

###### 3. **Basic Recommendations**
- Filters beers by predicted quality state
- Returns highest-rated beers within that quality category
- Simple content-based filtering approach

##### What It **Doesn't** Really Accomplish:

###### 1. **Not True Sequential Modeling**
- The transition matrix is artificially created using brewery groupings
- Beer ratings don't naturally form sequences like speech or time series
- **This is the biggest flaw** - HMMs are meant for sequential data

###### 2. **Limited Feature Usage**
- Only uses ABV, IBU, and style in a very basic way
- Ignores brewery reputation, beer name, serving size effects
- The quality scoring is overly simplistic

###### 3. **No User Personalization**
- Doesn't learn individual user preferences
- Can't adapt to different taste profiles
- One-size-fits-all recommendations

##### What It Could Be Improved To Do:
Better approach - treat beer tasting as a sequence:
- User's beer journey: Light Lager → Pale Ale → IPA → Stout
- Hidden states: User preference evolution
- Observations: Their ratings of different beer types

Or model brewery quality over time:
- Hidden states: Brewery reputation (declining/stable/improving)
- Observations: Beer ratings from that brewery
- Transitions: How brewery quality changes over time



##### Honest Assessment:
This HMM is more of a **proof-of-concept** that demonstrates:
- How to structure an HMM for a domain problem
- Basic parameter learning from data
- Simple recommendation logic

But it's **not particularly effective** because:
1. Beer recommendation isn't naturally a sequential problem
2. A simple collaborative filtering or content-based approach would work better
3. The model artificially forces sequential structure where none exists

##### Better Alternative:
For the beer recommendation system, it would get better results with:
- **Content-based filtering** using beer features
- **Collaborative filtering** if we had user-beer rating pairs  
- **Hybrid approach** combining multiple signals
- **Classification model** to predict if a user will like a beer

## Agent Setup, Data Preprocessing, Training Setup (15pts)

### Dataset Exploration & Variable Analysis

**Feature Importance Hierarchy:**


```
Primary Predictors (Direct Beer Characteristics)
├── style_encoded: Most discriminative (100+ categories)
│   ├── IPAs: Typically higher ratings, hop-forward
│   ├── Stouts: Rich, complex flavors
│   └── Lagers: Light, accessible styles
├── abv_filled: Strength preference indicator (3-12% range)
├── ibu_filled: Bitterness tolerance (0-200 IBU range)
└── brewery_reputation: Quality signal (1.0-5.0 average rating)

Secondary Features (Engineered Categories)
├── abv_category_encoded: Discretized strength levels
├── ibu_category_encoded: Discretized bitterness levels
├── style_popularity: Market presence indicator
└── ounces: Serving size (minimal predictive power)
```

**Variable Roles & Interactions:**

1. **Style (Primary Discriminator)**: Most important feature - different styles have distinct rating patterns
2. **ABV (Strength Indicator)**: Interacts with style (IPAs typically stronger than lagers)
3. **IBU (Bitterness Level)**: Correlates with style and user tolerance
4. **Brewery Reputation**: Quality baseline - good breweries make better beers consistently
5. **Categorical Features**: Capture non-linear relationships in continuous variables

### Model Architecture & Structure Choice

**Gaussian Naive Bayes Selection Rationale:**

```python
# Model assumes: P(liked|features) ∝ P(liked) × ∏P(feature_i|liked)
# Where each P(feature_i|liked) follows Gaussian distribution for continuous features
```

**Why This Structure:**
1. **Mixed Data Handling**: Gaussian NB naturally handles continuous features (ABV, IBU, reputation)
2. **Categorical Integration**: Label encoding allows categorical features in same framework
3. **Speed & Simplicity**: No hyperparameter tuning, fast training/prediction
4. **Interpretability**: Clear probabilistic interpretation of results
5. **Robust to Small Data**: Performs reasonably with limited training examples

**Parameter Calculation Process:**

```python
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB

# 1. Class Prior Estimation
P(liked) = count(liked_beers) / total_beers
P(not_liked) = count(not_liked_beers) / total_beers

# 2. Feature Likelihood Estimation (for continuous features)
μ_liked = mean(feature_values | liked)
σ²_liked = variance(feature_values | liked)
P(feature|liked) = N(μ_liked, σ²_liked)

# 3. Prediction (Bayes' Rule)
P(liked|features) = P(liked) × ∏P(feature_i|liked) / P(features)
```

**Library Usage:**
- **scikit-learn**: Provides GaussianNB with optimized parameter estimation using maximum likelihood
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and feature engineering
- **numpy**: Numerical operations and array handling
